	<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>

	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>In my implementation of creating masses and springs, first of all, I define the spacing between the point masses and then do the calculation of the 
		distance between adjacent point masses along the width, height, and depth directions of the grid. Then I create point masses for each point on the 
		grid by iterating through all possible combinations of width and height indices. If the point mass is on a pinned location (meaning it should not 
		move during the simulation), then I create the point mass with the <code>is_pinned</code> flag set to true.   
	</p>

	<p>After all point masses are created, I then create springs by looping through each row and column of the grid again and creating springs between adjacent 
		point masses. I created three types of springs: <b>structural, shearing,</b> and <b>bending</b> springs. Structural springs connect horizontally and 
		vertically adjacent point masses, while shearing springs connect diagonally adjacent point masses. Bending springs connect point masses that are two 
		units away in the horizontal or vertical direction. Then I use function emplace_back() to add the created springs to a springs vector. Once all 
		springs have been created, I return and the grid is ready to be used in the cloth simulation. One problem I had was I forgot to check if the point 
		mass is pinned, then I went back to spec and added it. Then it is solved.

	<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>

	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>In my implementation of simulation, first I applied the external force to each point mass by setting the forces of each point mass to be the external 
		force. I then iterate through all the springs and calculate the spring forces on each spring based on the type of spring and the parameters of the 
		cloth. Then I update the forces of the two point masses connected by the spring accordingly. After that, I calculate the acceleration of each point 
		mass by dividing the sum of the forces on the point mass by the mass of the point mass. I then updates the new position of each point mass using the 
		Verlet integration method based on its previous position, last position, acceleration, and damping. Lastly, I iterate through all the springs in the 
		cloth and apply constraints to ensures that the cloth does not stretch infinitely.
	</p>

	<p>One problem I had was I forgot to check if the spring length is greater than 110% of the rest length. Then I added the conditions and problem solved.</p>
	
	<h3>Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? A high <code>ks</code>?</h3>

	<h4>Effects of changing the spring constant ks:</h4>

	<p>The ks determines how stiff the springs in the cloth are, and therefore, affects the behavior of the cloth when it is subjected to external forces. Below 
		are images from 50 ks to 50000 ks.
	</p>

	<div align="middle">
		<table style="width=100%">
		  <tr>
			<td>
			  <img src="img/part1-7.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>

		  </td>
		  </tr>
		</table>
	</div>

	<p>When the value of ks is low, the springs are very flexible, and the cloth will deform easily in response to external forces. In this case, the cloth 
		will appear to be more fluid and flowy. When the value of ks is high, the springs are much stiffer, and the cloth will resist deformation more 
		effectively. The cloth will oscillate less when it is disturbed, and it will settle back into its resting state quickly. In this case, the cloth will 
		appear to be more rigid and less flexible. A lower ks value will result in a more flexible and fluid cloth, while a higher ks value will result in a 
		more rigid and less flexible cloth.
	</p>

	<h4>Effects of changing the density:</h4>

	<p>Below are images from vary density. It looks like When a cloth has a very low density, it is lightweight and easily deformable. It stretches easily 
		and not require much force to manipulate. It is more easily set into motion and also take longer to come to rest due to its lightweight nature. On 
		the other hand, a cloth with a high density looks more substantial and heavier. It requires more force to manipulate and it is easier to create 
		defined folds and creases. As the density is increased, the cloth looks heavier and more compact, making it less prone to fluttering or drifting.
	</p>

	</div>

	<h4>Effects of changing the damping:</h4>

	<p>Below are images of damping 0 and damping 1. When the damping of a cloth is set to 0, the cloth moves very freely and continue to oscillate for 
		some time even after the initial disturbance. The cloth was dropping down and moving back and forth very fast. The reason is that there is no 
		resistance to the motion and the cloth will continue to move until it loses energy due to friction or other factors. When the damping of a cloth is 
		set to 1, the cloth drops down really slow and comes to rest almost immediately after it is disturbed. As the damping of a cloth is increased 
		gradually, the cloth becomes more and more resistant to motion. Thus it takes longer for the cloth to settle down to rest after being disturbed.

	<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>

	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p> In this part of the project, we implemented collision between the cloth and other objects in the scene. We started by implementing collision with a 
		sphere in <code>Sphere::collide</code>. The function takes a point mass and checks if it collides with the sphere, and if it does, it adjusts its 
		position so that the point mass lies just above the sphere's surface. To check for the collision, we get the distance between the point's position and
		the center of the sphere. If this distance is smaller or equal to the radius of the sphere, that means that the objects collide. We call the intersection
		point our tangent point, and ajust the point mass' position based on the tangent and the point's <code>last_position</code>. After implementing collision 
		with a sphere, we implemented collision with a plane. The idea behind it was similar to the implementation behind collision with spheres. First, we 
		use the dot product between the plane's normal and the point's position to determine whether there was a collision. We then use the tangent point and 
		a <code>SURFACE_OFFSET</code> value to adjust the point's position on the surface of the plane.
	</p>

	<p>Finally, we update the function <code>Cloth::simulate</code> to check for each point mass wether it collides with each object in the scene. This part 
		was fairly straightforward, with only a few lines to implement, and it follows the spec's instructions step by step.
	</p>

	<h3>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere using the default ks = 5000 as well as with 
		ks = 500 and ks = 50000. Describe the differences in the results.
	</h3>

	<p>The images below show the final resting state of the cloth on the sphere with increasing ks values. As we can see, as the spring constant ks increases
		the cloth appears to get more rigid, and drapes less easily over the sphere. With a ks of 500, the cloth frames the sphere almost perfectly, while 
		with a ks of 50000 the cloth does not bend as much around the sphere, with a lot more open air between the objects.

	<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>

	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>In my implementation of handing self-collision, first, I build a spatial map out of all the point masses in the cloth simulation to use the position 
		of the point mass as the key to look up potential candidates for collision. Then, I implemented the <code>function self_collide()</code> by first looking up its 
		potential collision candidates using the hash table. Then I check the distance between the point mass and each candidate, and if they are within 2 
		times the thickness of the cloth, I compute a correction vector that can be applied to the point mass to move it to the correct distance. The 
		correction vector is the difference between the current distance and the desired distance, multiplied by a unit vector in the direction of the 
		candidate. Then I add up all the correction vectors for all the collision candidates and takes the average, which represents the overall correction 
		that needs to be applied to the point mass. If there were no collision candidates within the threshold distance, no correction is applied. Finally, 
		I calculated the correction vector by dividing the simulation steps and added to the position of the point mass to move it to the correct distance 
		from its collision candidates. Lastly, I compute <code>hash_position()</code> function, I compute the dimensions of each box in the spatial map based on the 
		width, height, and number of points in the cloth simulation, truncate position to box coordinates, and compute unique number for box coordinates.

	<h4>Affect of changing density:</h4>

	<p>Below are cloth images of vary density, which with density 1, density 50, density 500. When the density of the cloth is set to 1, the cloth is light 
		and more susceptible to external forces, leading to a more fluid motion and slower fall. The forces within the cloth are also weaker, resulting in 
		looser folds and wrinkles as the cloth falls. The point masses inside the cloth structure are further apart, leading to a more spread-out and 
		billowy look. As density increases,The forces within the cloth are stronger, leading to tighter folds and wrinkles as the cloth falls. The point 
		masses inside the cloth structure are closer to each other, leading to a more compact and dense look. When the density increase to 500, we can see 
		that the cloth become more tangled and twisted.

	<h4>Affect of changing ks:</h4>

	<p>Below are images of cloth vary ks with 50 ks, 500 ks, 50000 ks. When ks is 50, it creates a lot of small wrinkles and folds, which make the overall 
		appearance of the cloth look more complex and intricate patterns of folds and creases. As ks increases, It creates larger, angular folds instead of 
		small wrinkles and as the simulation progresses, the cloth remains stiff and ridged, with few visible folds or wrinkles, resting in a more rigid 
		position. Lower ks values make the cloth to have more small wrinkles and folds. Moderate ks values create more pronounced folds, while high 
		ks(50000) values create a stiff, rigid appearance with few visible folds tend to lay flatter and smoother.

	<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>

	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>In the last part of the project, we implemented shaders, which are programs that run separately in parallel with our renderer to compute shading
		of objects. Since shaders run separately in the GPU, they are used to accelerate rendering time. We implemented shaders here through GLSL, and in 
		this part we implement two different types of shaders: vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders receive the information of a vertex and 
		apply transform to vertices, such as changing positions, and sets their geometric properties to be used by fragment shaders. Fragment shaders 
		receive the geometric properties of a vertex and outputs an RGB color value for that vertex. In this part of the project, we implemented the following
		shaders: Diffuse Shading, Blinn-Phong Shading, Texture, Displacement and Bump mapping, and finally a Mirror shader. Throughout the implementation,
		most problems were due to incorrect normalization of vectors, and these were mostly fixed through reanalyzing the code and sometimes trial and error. 
	</p>

	<h3>Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen 
		shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
	</h3>

	<p>The Blinn-Phong shading model is a shader that calculates multiple lighting components. For each vertex, it calculates the diffuse, ambient and 
		specular lighting components of that point and outputs the combined lighting of the three.

	</h3>

	<p>The images below show bump and displacement mapping, both before and after the collision between the cloth and the sphere, using <code>texture_3.png</code>. 
		Both attempt to simulate texture with depth. Bump mapping does this by changing the normal vectors of an object to simulate geometry through the height map of
		a texture. This gives the sphere the impression of not being smooth and rather being texturized without changing the geometry of it.  Displacement mapping
		works similarly to bump mapping, however, it differs in that it actually changes the geometry of the vertice. and adjusts the normals to match the new 
		geometry. In the images below, we can see how both images appear texturized, but while bump mapping makes the sphere smooth and "perfect", displacement
		adds a level of physical noise that adds to the realism of the rendering.

	<p>The images below show Bump and Displacement mapping with different leves of sphere coarseness, or resolution, to see how this paramenter affects the rendering. As we
		can see, increasing the coarseness does not have much of an effect with Bump mapping, since this shader does not directly modify the object's geometry.
		However, in Displacement, we can see that as the sphere's coarseness increases, so does the level of noise around the sphere. With a resolution of 16,
		the sphere appears almost blocky, while it looks fuzzy with a resolution of 128. This is due to the higher amount of vertices being modified.
