	<h3>Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.</h3>

	<p>In this part of the assignment, we implemented reflection and refraction in order to render mirror and glass materials. With a max_ray_depth of 0, no bounces
		occur, which means that the only type of light that is rendered is <code>zero_bounce_radiance</code>. Therefore, the only thing visible is the light source
		on the top of the scene. With a max_ray_depth of 1, we have one bounce, and we can see how the light reflects on the scene directly, with no indirect
		lighting. If we look at the spheres closely, you can see how the left mirror sphere reflects the light source completly, while the right glass sphere 
		refracts the light, so only a random amount of the light source samples are reflected. With a max_ray_depth of 2, indirect lighting starts to take effect.
		Now, the mirror sphere starts getting rays that hit off other parts of the room first, starting to actually act like a mirror. However, the mirrored
		image that appears on the surface of the sphere appears as a max_ray_depth - 1, as is evidenced by the black roof of the room, so there is no indirect
		lighting being mirrored. The glass sphere shows some reflection as well, but there are still not enough bounces to properly refract, since the ray enters
		the sphere, but does not come out. At may_ray_depth of 3, refraction finally begins appearing, as now the exiting ray is computed. However, since the mirror
		renders an image with max_ray_depth - 1 bounces, the mirrored image of the glass sphere still appears black. The refraction also creates a spotlight from the 
		direct lighting rays, as is seen underneath the sphere. With a may_ray_depth of 4, we can see how the mirrored image of the glass ball appears correctly, 
		but still a little dark. Now that the refracted light rays can bounce more and interact with the rest of the scene, we notice another small spotlight on the
		right wall, and the image in general appears a little lighter. With max_ray_depth 5, the mirrored glass sphere looks a little lighter, but it is a subtle
		detail. From them on, increasing the max_ray_depth does not change the image much, the image looking extremely similar even with 100 bounces.

	<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Depth of Field</h2>

	<h3>In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model.</h3>

	<p>The pinhole camera model is a basic model of a camera that uses a small aperture (pinhole) to create an image on a flat surface (image plane). The size 
		of the aperture plays a significant role in determining the field of view and depth of field of the image. In this model, the image created is always 
		inverted and mirrored from left to right.
	</p>

	<p>In contrast, the thin-lens camera model is a more advanced model that considers the effects of refraction through a lens. The thin, curved lens of the 
		camera focuses the light onto the image plane, and the position and shape of the lens determine the field of view and depth of field of the image. The 
		image produced by a thin-lens camera can be inverted or upright, depending on the orientation of the lens and the image plane. The primary advantage 
		of thin-lens cameras is their ability to produce sharp images with a shallow depth of field, while the primary benefit of pinhole cameras is their 
		simplicity and user-friendliness.
