<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this project we delved into geometric meshes, from implementing Bezier Curves through the Casteljau algorithm to manipulating triangle meshes with 
  methods such as splitting and flipping edges and upsampling. This project benefitted from the use of the HalfedgeMesh struct, which facilitated the access 
  to relevant elements of the meshes, such as vertex and edges, helping keep the code clean and readable.

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h2>

<p>In the first part of the project, we had to modify the <code>BezierCurve::evaluateStep(...)</code> function in order to implement Bezier Curves into
  the project through the Casteljau algorithm. Bezier Curves are used to create smooth curves from a set of input points that configure a line. The Casteljau
  method achieves this by performing linear interpolation between adjacent points in the line with a parameter \(t\) that ranges between 0 and 1 
  in order to generate control points. Each step generates \(n-1\) control points, \(n\) being the amount of input points. The process is repeated recursively
  until the algorithm returns a single and last point, which is then used in order to calculate the Bezier Curve, although that part was not supposed to be 
  implemented by us in this project. It is important to note that the modified function only deals with one step of the recursion, returning only one set of 
  control points, and is not responsible for dealing with the recursion to achieve the last control point.
</p>

<p>The following images show the resulting steps in order to reach the final point and the completed Bezier Curve that was generated:</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h2>
<p>In the second part of the project, we were asked to implement the Casteljau algorithm to Bezier Surfaces that are defined in a grid of \(n x n\) control 
  points with parameters \(u,v\), instead of the Bezier Curves. In order to implement this, we had to modify the functions <code>BezierPatch::evaluateStep(...)</code>, 
  <code>BezierPatch::evaluate1D(...)</code> and <code>BezierPatch::evaluate(...)</code>.
</p>
<p>We started off by adapting the <code>BezierCurve::evaluateStep(...)</code> implemented in Part 1 to perform a Casteljau Subdivision to a 3D vector, instead
  of a 2D one. Since the algorithm only performs a linear interpolation and returns the control points, this can be easily adapted by simply changing the 
  returning vector list to return Vector3D control points in place of Vector2D ones. The linear interpolation works regardless of size of vectors.
</p>
<p>The <code>BezierPatch::evaluate1D(...)</code> function was also very simple to implement, as it is meant to return the last point of the Casteljau Sudivision
  in a row or column of points of the Bezier Surface. Therefore, it was as easy as running a recursive loop on the <code>BezierPatch::evaluateStep(...)</code> 
  until the last step is completed, and returning the last point.
</p>
<p>The last function to be implemented was <code>BezierPatch::evaluate(...)</code>, which takes as input the \(u, v\) parameters of the point in the Bezier
  Surface and returns the coordinates of the point that lies on the Bezier Surface. This is done by firstly running the <code>BezierPatch::evaluate1D(...)</code> 
  function on each row of the grid using \(u\) as the \(t\) parameter. The control points for the rows are saved, and we run <code>BezierPatch::evaluate1D(...)</code>
  once using \(v\) as the \(t\) parameter and arrive at the point that lies on the Bezier Surface.

<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals </h2>
<p>In this part we implement shading on a mesh surface by using area-weighted vertex normals. These normals can be used for Phong shading, which provides 
  smoother surfaces than flat shading. It is also worth mentioning that from this part of the project on, we will be using halfedge data structure, which 
  makes it a lot easier to work with the mesh. To implement this, we modified the <code>Vertex::normal()</code> function. In order to calculate the weighted 
  normal, we must iterate over all faces incident to the vertex. During each iteration, we gather all vertices that belong to that face, and we calculate the 
  normal of that triangle through the <code>cross()</code> function. The normal of each triangle is added to a vector that contains the sum of all normals 
  of the incident faces, and that vector is normalized in order into the area-weighted normal.
</p>
<p>The images below show the comparison of a teapot with and without vertex normals. It is clear in the images how the applied vertex normals render a smoother
  model than the flat shading.

<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h2>
<p>In Part 4, we were asked to implement an edge flip mesh operation. An edge flip takes an edge connecting two triangles and flips it so that it connects
  the other two vertices that were not previously connected, converting the original two triangles into a different pair. 
</p>
<p>To implement this operation, first we have to gather all important elements of the two triangles. This includes the halfedges associated with the original
  triangles, the four vertices, and the two triangle faces. This was done by using the halfedge data structure. Once we have all the needed information regarding
  the original triangles, we must reassign the values related to the halfedge pointers so that they can refer to the proper updated elements. For each halfedge
  we assign their new neighbor, their twin halfedge, what vertex it is associated with, and what edge and face it belongs to. The flipped edge, for example, 
  has its halfedges associated with the two previously unconnected vertices. Once all halfedges are reassigned, we reassign for each vertex their new updated
  relative halfedge. 
</p>
<p>Most of the bugs related to this part were due to improper reassignment of halfedges properties. These were solved by utilising the <code>check_for()</code>
  provided function and the element inspector in the GUI to manually check the reassigned elements of halfedges, and then double-checking the diagram.
</p>
<p>The images below show a close-up of an area of the teapot model before and after applying a few edge flips to create a pattern:</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split </h2>
<p>Part 5 of this project asks us to implement another mesh operation: edge split. When an edge between two triangles is split, it splits the edge in two and
  creates two other edges that connect the two unconnected vertices, splitting the two triangles into four triangles and creating another vertice in the point
  where all inner edges meet. The implementation is very similar to the edge flip, made mostly through the reassingment of element properties, however it
  differs in that more elements are created. To be more specific, six halfedges, three edges, two faces and one vertex must be created in this part. The only
  different step when splitting an edge is the assignment of the new vertex coordenates, which can be easily calculated by the means of the two vertices that
  connect the original edge. After reassigning the elements of all halfedges, and properly updating the relative halfedges of all faces, vertices and edges,
  the edge is split.
</p>
<p>Bugs relating to this part of the project were mostly noted during the implementation of Part 6. Initially, the code seemed to be working correctly,
  but upon implementation of Part 6 it was noted that (1) There were more elements that were created than necessary, which had to be removed, and instead 
  existing elements were reassigned to match the previously created elements (2) There was improper assignment of the isNew property of the edges, which lead
  to problems in Part 6. These were resolved by utilizing the element inspector in the GUI in the first case and pure trial and error on the second. In 
  Part 6, during debugging with the element inspector and the <code>check_for()</code> function, it was also seen that the halfedge returned by the 
  <code>->halfedge()</code> was not the expected halfedge according to the diagrams provided, and so a long process of renaming, reorganizing and reassigning
  halfedges was done before solving the two problems mentioned above, and these changes were kept for convenience, but I don't believe they were necessary.
</p>
<p>The images below show the same area of the teapot highlighted in Part 4 with the before and after of edge splits, along with a combination of edge splits
  and edge flips.

<h2 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h2>
<p>In the last part of the project, we implemented Mesh Upsampling with Loop Subdivision. This process uses a combination of edge splits and flips to upsample
  a mesh by dividing each triangle into 4 smaller triangles and updating all vertices positions with weighted values, creating a higher resolution mesh.
</p>
<p>This was implemented in five steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    First we calculate the updated positions of all existing vertices. This was done by iterating through all existing vertices in the mesh and calculating 
    the new position based on that vertex's degree and the sum of all neighboring vertices' positions. The new value was saved in the <code>newPosition</code>
    property of the vertex, so that it can be changed after all mesh operations have been done. Note that in this step, for the sake of future steps, all
    existing vertices have their <code>isNew</code> property assigned to false, so to keep track of pre-existing and created vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then we calculate the weighted positions of the new vertices that will be created. This is done by iterating through all edges in the mesh, since all edges
    will be split, and calculating the weighted position based on the coordinates of the vertices of the triangles related to that edge. This value is saved
    to the <code>newPosition</code> property of the edge, since the vertices have not yet been created.
  </li>
  <li>
    We then begin splitting the edges. Only the pre-existing edges must be split, or else we would get an infinite loop of new edges being created and then 
    split. We iterate over all pre-existing edges of the mesh, splitting them and reassigning each created vertex's <code>newPosition</code> to the one saved
    to the edge in the previous step. Created vertices also have their <code>isNew</code> property set to true.
  </li>
  <li>
    Next, we must flip the edges that connect newly created vertices to pre-existing ones. This is done because in subdivision, all new edges must connect
    only new points in order to properly divide the triangle. Since all old edges still only connect old vertices, we iterate over all new edges and check 
    the <code>isNew</code> value of the two vertices that it connects. If they are not equal, we perform a flip on that edge so that it connects the new
    vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, we reassign all vertices positions to their pre-calculated positions saved in <code>newPosition</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

      </td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
</div>
<p>In the images above, we can observe that in loop subdivision, sharp edges and corners tend to get rounded off, losing its sharpness, and the upsampled 
  cube seems to become asymetrical. This happens because the faces of the cube are only divided into two triangles diagonally, which when split end up 
  "warping" the model. In the second and third image this becomes apparent by the way the lightning shading reflects off the surface of the cube in a diamond
  like shape. This effect can be reduced by pre-splitting the edges that run diagonally on the faces of the cube, so that each face is divided into 4 symetrical
  triangles, with the cube looking the same regardless of orientation. The images below show the loop subdivisions of a cube with pre-splitted edges:

</div>
<p>Most of the bugs seen in this portion of the assignment were due to problems in the implementation of the edgeSplit function. Changes and debugging to this
  was addressed in the Part 5 section. Besides the problems with the split function, a few problems were had when performing the splitting part of the implementation
  due to the new edge and old edge filtering. Simply creting an if with the <code>!edge->isNew</code> argument did not attend to our needs, so we reverted back
  to saving the initial number of edges in the mesh in a variable and running a for loop based on this, guaranteeing only the old edges were iterated over.
